## Setup

This App uses a fork of [c3media-base][c3media-base-orig] as a module -> Credits to [Tobias Preuss][tobias-preuss].

It is important to clone the latest `master` of [this fork][c3media-base-fork] into the same repository. E.g. `~/repo/cccTV/` and `~/repo/c3media-base/`:

```
cd ~/repo/
git clone https://github.com/stefanmedack/cccTV
git clone https://github.com/stefanmedack/c3media-base
